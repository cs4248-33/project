## Abstract

The IWSLT 2017 Chineseâ€“English translation project aims to develop a robust sentence-level machine translation model using a large dataset of 230,000 paired sentences for training and 8500 paired sentences for testing.

We have conducted literature review of sentence-level translation models and techniques, identifying suitable neural network architectures that we can use, taking into account the tradeoffs between performance and compute requirements. We have also researched on preprocessing techniques and  appropriate evaluation metrics.
